Feel free to use this and stuff, you can literally take the code out of it if you want (although some of it was "inspired" by a tutorial)
It'd be nice if you let me know what you want to use it for (and credit me if you use a lot of it), but no pressure
If you make a better version of this send it to me, and put your own credits below this
